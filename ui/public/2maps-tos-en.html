        <p>2.1. To use certain Yat services or certain specific functions of services, the User
            shall complete registration to create a unique account. A user shall reach the minimum age of 16
            years in order to exercise the right to register an account and use Yat services independently
            within the legal capacity established by applicable law. Minors may only use the services with the
            consent of parents or other legal representatives, or when as it is prescribed otherwise by
            applicable law. Certain Yat services may impose other age restrictions, which may additionally be
            indicated in legal documents or in the interface / description of the site, application and / or
            other software product.</p>
        <p>2.2. Upon registration the User shall provide valid and complete information requested in
            the registration form and shall regularly update such information. If the User provides invalid
            information or Yat has reasons to believe that any information provided by the User is incomplete
            or invalid, Yat may at its discretion block or delete the User’s account or deny the User the use
            of any services (or certain functions).</p>
        <p>When signing up, the User may upload an image for his/her profile (user icon). The profile
            image can be attached to the User’s posts in Yat services. The profile image shall meet the
            requirements of Section 4 of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>When the User uses his/her image as a profile image, the User is aware and agrees that

            the information provided upon registration and to request supporting documents (personal
            identification documents in particular); failure to provide these documents may, at Yat's
            discretion, be regarded as provision of invalid information and entail consequences according to
            Clause 2.2 hereof. In case the User's information specified in the documents provided by him/her
            fails to conform to the information provided upon registration or if the information provided upon
