    <section>
        <h2>4. What type of Personal information is collected by Yat</h2>
        <p>Personal information collected when you use the Sites and/or Services may differ depending on
            whether you access the Sites or Services while logged in to your Yat user account or without logging
            in. When you are logged in to your Yat user account as you are using the Sites or Services, Personal
            information collected by Yat may be collated and combined with other Personal information (such as
            your identity, contact details, if you shared this information with us) collected by
            Yat in your user account. Yat does not verify Personal information provided by you unless
            otherwise provided in the Terms of Use or License Agreement of relevant Services, and does not decide
            the its credibility or whether you have the legal capacity required. However, Yat assumes that the
            information you provide is true, sufficiently complete and up-to-date.</p>
        <p>Personal information collected by Yat when you access, interact with or operate the Sites
            and/or Services includes:</p>
        <p>(i) information provided by you when you register (create) a user account, such as your name;</p>
        <p>(ii) electronic data (http headers, IP address, cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, browser
            information, information about your hardware and software, wi-fi network data);</p>
        <p>(iii) date and time of accessing the Sites or Services;</p>
        <p>(iv) information related to your activity while using the Sites or Services (e.g. your search
            history, data on purchases in the Services, as well as files and content stored in Yat systems);</p>
        <p>(v) (geo)location information;</p>
        <p>(vi) other information about you that needs to be processed according to the terms and
            conditions of any specific Yat Site or Service;</p>
        <p>In addition, Yat uses cookies and web beacons (including pixel tags) to collect your
            Personal information and associate this Personal information with your device and web browser (see
            Section 11 below).</p>
        <p>Yat does not actively collect any sensitive personal data (such as racial origins, political
            opinions, health or biometric data) unless specified in Terms of Use of relevant Services. However, you
            may voluntarily provide us with such data and we may process it as part of providing you with our
            Services (e.g. if you perform search queries related to your health). As we do not know in advance the
            potentially sensitive nature of the personal data you may provide to us, you must be aware that we may
            not be able to request your consent with such processing.</p>
        <p>Yat does not perform any form of profiling, which has the potential to significantly impact
            your rights and freedoms in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>5. What are the legal basis for processing your Personal information and the purposes of it</h2>
        <p>Yat is not allowed to process your Personal information if it does not have a valid legal
            ground. Yat will therefore only process your Personal information if:</p>
        <p>(i) the processing is necessary to perform our contractual obligations towards you including
            providing you with Sites and/or Services (i.e. providing you with the results of your search query);</p>
        <p>(ii) the processing is necessary to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations; </p>
        <p>(iii) in case it is provided by applicable law, the processing is necessary for the legitimate
            interests of Yat and does not unduly affect your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Please
            note that when we process your Personal information on this basis, we will always seek to maintain a
            balance between our legitimate interest and the protection of your privacy.</p>
        <p>Examples of such ‘legitimate interests’ referred in (iii) immediately above are:</p>
        <p>(a) to better understand how you interact with our Sites and/or Services;</p>
        <p>(b) to enhance, maintaining accessibility, modify, personalize or otherwise improve the Sites
            and Services for the benefit of all users; and</p>
        <p>(c) to offer you other products and services from Yat or other companies which we think can
            be of interest to you (i.e. personally-targeted advertising).</p>
        <p>(iv) for specific purposes or if consent is required under the applicable laws and regulations,
            we may ask your consent for processing of your Personal information. In those jurisdictions in which
            consent is the legal basis, you provide such consent by agreeing to use our Sites and/or Services. We
            hereby inform you, and you hereby acknowledge, that you have no legal obligation to provide us with any
            Personal Information when you use the Sites or Services, and the provision of it is solely based on your
            free will. However, you are aware that without the provision of Personal Information, we will not be
            able to provide you with Services and your use of the Sites will be limited.</p>
        <p>Yat always processes your Personal information for a specific purpose and only processes
            Personal information, which is relevant to achieve that purpose. In particular, we process your Personal
            information for the following purposes:</p>
        <p>(i) to provide you with the Sites and/or Services (i.e. delivery of search results in response
            to your search queries, taking into account your preferences, search history and other Personal
            information about you available to Yat);</p>
        <p>(ii) to provide you with access to your user account, including your email,
            if you have an account for these Services;</p>
        <p>(iii) to contact you to notify and/or inform you or request information from you in relation to
            the Sites and Services, or to execute our agreements with you or process your request or application;
        </p>
        <p>(iv) to personalize advertisements and/or commercial offers based on your preferences, search
            history and other Personal information available to Yat.;</p>
        <p>(v) to improve user experience, including offering more relevant search results and more
            personalised Sites and/or Services, as well as improving other Yat products, applications and
            services;</p>
        <p>(vi) to develop new products, applications and services;</p>
        <p>(vii) to protect your rights and the rights of Yat; and</p>
        <p>(viii) to collect, process and present statistical data or big data, or perform other research
            and/or analysis of Personal information.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The use of information received from the Google API (Received Data) in Yat
            Services is exercised in accordance with the <a
                href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes"
                target="_blank">Google API Disclosure</a> subject to the restrictions specified therein, namely:</p>
        <p>Yat uses the Received Data. The Received Data is not offered for use by third parties, displaying advertising
            materials and other purposes

    <section>
        <h2>6. How Yat protects your Personal
            information</h2>
        <p>In most cases, Personal information is processed automatically without access to it by our
            staff. However, if such access is necessary, your Personal information can be accessed only by those
            Yat employees whose professional tasks require using this information. To protect your Personal
            information and ensure its confidentiality, these employees must comply with internal rules and follow
            protocols for processing Personal information. They are also required to follow all technical and
            organisational security measures protecting your Personal information.</p>
        <p>Yat has also implemented adequate technical and organisational measures to protect Personal
            information against unauthorised, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse,
            disclosure or access and against all other unlawful forms of processing. These security measures have
            been implemented taking into account the state of the art of the technology, their cost of
            implementation, the risks presented by the processing and the nature of Personal information.</p>

        <h2>7. Who else has access to your Personal
            information and who is it shared with</h2>
        <p>7.1 <strong>Within the Yat group</strong></p>
        <p>Yat may transfer your Personal information to our employees (within the limits set out in
            Section 6 above). Yat may also transfer your Personal information to its affiliates including other
            companies of the group to which Yat belongs. Please note that the level of
            protection of Personal Information in some countries may not be identical to the level required in your
            jurisdiction, by using the Services you consent to such transfer. In all cases, Personal information
            will continue to be processed only for the purposes set out in Section 5 hereof unless otherwise stated
            by the terms of use of the Sites or Services that are provided by companies of the Yat.
